## Overview

Steamboat is a mock attempt at creating an App for a real world company. The goal is to achieve a mobile-based technology used to manage check-in of guests on a packaged ski trip / music festival.

### Level of access

In this App we have 2 different access levels for the user accounts: the management level and the employee level.
* Management: users are able to manage all of the user accounts, and packages for sale.
* Employee: users are only able to check read-only status of current packages, create an order, and check in customers.

### Future features in mind

In the future we plan to add:
* customization ability for the management
  * customize how the package creation takes in properties
  * customize how the dashboard would look eg. what items to display
* logging system for site activities:
  * keep a log of all of the orders
  * log all of the employee level accounts' activity (eg. order creation and customer checkin)
* invoice feature for customers
* live chat feature between team members
